Conference Track Management

Assumptions/Adjustments

* Each track is divided into multiple sessions and each session is further divided into multiple slots.
* Minimum and maximum durations of talks are configurable with a default value of 5 and 240 respectively.
* Validati0on strategy to handle Talks with duration shorter than minimum talk duration is configurable. The default action is to increase it to minimum duration. 
* Validation Strategy to handle invalid tasks (e.g. with duration more than maximum talk duration) is configurable. Default is to silently ignore those.
* Maximum number of tracks is configurable with a default value of 3.

HLD
The High Level Design is summarized by the following abstractions.

* InputProcessor: This abstraction is responsible for converting the input into list of Talk instances.
* Conference: Collection of Tracks.
* Track: Collection of Sessions.
* Session: Period of time available for various activities like Talks, Lunch, Networking etc.
* Talk: A Talk entry created by the InputProcessor. It is later assigned to a Session by AllocationStrategy.
* AllocationStrategy: Configurable time allotment algorithm to assign a Talk to Session. The default strategy is to LongestFirstStrategy that attempts to allot time to Talks in decreasing order of their length.
* ValidationStrategy: Configurable validation policy.
* ConferenceVisitor: Visitor pattern implementation to allow implementation of custom operations on various conference components.
